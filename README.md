TwitterCKB is an intelligent, blockchain-based seal assistant operating on the Nervos network. The "Seal Agent" interacts with users on Twitter, managing assets in both CKB and Seal tokens, sending gratitude tweets, distributing tokens, and posting status emoticons to provide real-time balance feedback, all while ensuring user data privacy.

## Project Overview

- **Token Rewards**: Randomly sends tokens (CKB or Seal) to users who interact with specific comments or hashtags.
- **Scheduled Status Emoticons**: Posts hourly status emoticons reflecting balance, keeping the seal's followers engaged.
- **Secure Transfers**: Provides safe CKB or Seal transfers based on user requests, ensuring transparency and data privacy.
